# Exercise 2: Circle Area
# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 7. Use 3.14159 for π.
import math


radius = 7
pi = 3.14159
# Calculate area = π × r²
area = pi * (radius**2)
print(area)

print("The code below is more refined")

# More refined code
area = math.pi * (radius**2)
print(area)


# Given these variables:
x = 10
y = 20
name1 = "Alice"
name2 = "Bob"
name3 = "Alice"

# Write expressions and print results:
# 1. Is x equal to y?
print(x == y)
# 2. Is x not equal to y?
print(x != y)
# 3. Is x less than y?
print(x < y)
# 4. Is x greater than y?
print(x > y)
# 5. Is x less than or equal to 10?
print(x <= 10)
# 6. Is y greater than or equal to 20?
print(y >= 20)
# 7. Is name1 equal to name3?
print(name1 == name3)
# 8. Is name1 equal to name2?
print(name1 == name2)
