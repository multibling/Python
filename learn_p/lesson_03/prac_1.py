# Exercise 1: Calculator Functions
# Create variables and perform these operations:

a = 15
b = 4
# Calculate and print: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division,
# modulus, exponentiation

# addition
toll = a + b
print(toll)

# subtraction
toll = a - b
print(toll)

# multiplication
toll = a * b
print(toll)

# division
toll = a / b
print(toll)

# floor
toll = a // b
print(toll)

# exponentiation
toll = a**b
print(toll)

# modulus (remainder)
toll = a % b
print(toll)

# negation (not[] is true)
if not a <= b:
    print("a is not less than or equal to b")

else:
    print("a is less than or equal to b")
